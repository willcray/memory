approach

read in a file containing logical addresses

get the page number and hash into the TLB
	if hit
		print success message
		concat frame number and offset
		access physical memory, print out data at that PA
	else
		print failure
		search in page table

		if not in the page table - seg fault
			print specific error

			if free frame list is not empty (memory not full)
				obtain frame from free frame list using first-fit
				loads the same VA page from the BACKING_STORE.bin file and places it into the first available
				prints success message
				update info in page table
					page number is index of page table to be updated
					update frame number at that index of the page table to the found frame
				update TLB
					if TLB full
						use FIFO to update
							update it by replacing old frame number at location the page number hased to with new frame number
					else
						update it by replacing old frame number at location the page number hased to with new frame number
			else
				handle page replacement using the LRU method22
				update page table for both incoming and outgoing pages
				print success message including what frame the page is loaded into
				update TLB using FIFO if necessary
		else
			get frame number and update TLB using FIFO if necessary

after processing
print contents of the page table
print contents of page frames
print page-fault rate
print TLB hit-rate
